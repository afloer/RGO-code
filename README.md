# RGO-code
Code for Reactive Global Optimization (two directories: code and one example of use)

The Reactive Glocal Optimization (RGO) approach, originally proposed in Ref.[https://doi.org/10.1039/C1NR11051A] and later varied in unpublished releases and employed in several applications e.g. Refs.[https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4891564; https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201709784], aims at an unbiased exploration (sampling) of the Potential Energy Surfaces (PES) specifically for activated processes and described via an atomistic model [David Wales. Energy Landscapes: Applications to Clusters, Biomolecules and Glasses. Cambridge Molecular Science. Cambridge University Press, 2004]. It is made of systematic single-ended searches (typically eigenvector-following) combined with filtering on energy barriers. Comparison with competitor approaches: With respect to meta-dynamics [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.20242739], it has the advantage of being unbiased (unsupervised) and systematic, i.e., in the applications thus far it has been able to find all nearest-neighbors of a given non-diffusive local basin (local minimum). With respect to Pathsample [https://doi.org/10.1021/jp970984n], which first performs a Global Optimization and then systematically connects the resulting local minima via Nudged Elastic Band [https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1329672] simulations, it focuses on kinetics-determined processes, such as typically catalytic ones.
