This is an example of RGO results.
A structure called Initial.xyz was used as an input with cutoffs 0.9 0.9.
The potential is a neural network Behler Parrinello called using LAMMPS interface of OPTIM.
Second derivatives are done numerically since analytical ones have not been implemented yet.

This is the state after two iterations of the code. More than 100 structures have been found.
